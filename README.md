# Student-Exam-Analysis
In this project will leverage Python's data analysis capabilities to uncover insights from a chosen dataset. We'll begin by utilizing libraries like Pandas to import and explore the data, identifying any missing values or inconsistencies. Data cleaning techniques will be applied to ensure the data's accuracy. Next, we'll perform exploratory data analysis using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize trends and relationships within the data. This might involve creating histograms, scatter plots, or boxplots. Finally, depending on the project's goals, we might use libraries like scikit-learn to build models to make predictions or uncover deeper patterns within the data. Throughout the project, clear and concise code will be documented to ensure reproducibility and understanding.
